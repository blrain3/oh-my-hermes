"""Retained retrieval fixtures for the project-memory recall regression suite.

This module is data plus one materializer. It holds no ranking, eligibility, or
budget logic: every expectation below is a recorded verdict about what the
production recall-pack builder must return, never a second implementation of
how it decides.

Two properties make the corpus a regression gate rather than a snapshot:

- The clock is part of the fixture. Every timestamp is absolute and the case
  clock is ``FIXTURE_CLOCK``, so a case that depends on expiry, review
  deadlines, or age tiers reads the same on any host on any day. No fixture
  here reads the wall clock, directly or through a default argument.
- Record order is the order written here, and the store reader sorts by file
  name, so neither dict iteration nor filesystem order can reorder a pack.

Each case declares the records, the pins, the delivery counters, the query,
the scope and perspective lens, the budgets, and the expected disposition of
every record: included in this order, excluded for this named reason, or
absent because a lens filtered it before the pack could name it.
